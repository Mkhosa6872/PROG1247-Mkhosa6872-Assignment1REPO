            <em>Since its opening, Yokohama has served as a window for exchange between Japan 
                    and the rest of the world, fostering an attractive cityscape and rich culture with 
                    historic buildings and beautiful landscapes.
                    Gundam, which attracts a high level of attention from overseas, and Japan's manufacturing
